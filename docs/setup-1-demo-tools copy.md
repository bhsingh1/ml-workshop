# Adding users to the workshop
We provide a sample 30 user setup: _user1_.._user30_ each with the password _openshift_
These have beeen populated to the file _users.htpasswd_ in this directory.
First we create a secret with those users and their password:
```
oc create secret generic htpass-secret --from-file=htpasswd=users.htpasswd -n openshift-config
```
We've created a custom resource that sets up this htpasswd mechanism on OpenShift - which we apply as follows:
```
oc apply -f htpasswd.cr
```

If you need to give the users access to their own namespace(project), say _userX-project_. We also need to give Jenkins (used for CICD) access to each user's project.
That can be done as follows:
```
for i in {1..30}
do
    oc new-project user$i-project
    oc adm policy add-role-to-user admin user$i -n user$i-project
    oc adm policy add-role-to-user admin user$i -n ml-workshop
    oc create sa seldon-manager -n user${i}-project
    oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin system:serviceaccount:user${i}-project:seldon-manager -n user${i}-project
    oc adm policy add-role-to-user admin system:serviceaccount:ml-workshop:jenkins-ml-jenkins -n user$i-project
done
```

If you need to create users with different credentials consult [this blog](https://medium.com/kubelancer-private-limited/create-users-on-openshift-4-dc5cfdf85661) - on which these instructions are based.
